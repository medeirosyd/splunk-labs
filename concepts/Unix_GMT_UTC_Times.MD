UNIX time is the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), 1 January 1970. This moment in time is sometimes referred to as epoch time.

GMT is a time zone officially used in some European and African countries as their local time. The time is displayed in either the 24-hour format (00:00-23:59) or the 12-hour format (00:00-12:00 AM/PM).

UTC is a time standard that is the basis for time and time zones worldwide. No country uses UTC as a local time.

GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) is sometimes confused with UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). However GMT is a time zone and UTC is a time standard.

Neither GMT nor UTC ever change for Daylight Saving Time (DST). However, some of the countries that use GMT switch to different time zones during their DST period. For example, the United Kingdom uses GMT for most of the year, but switches to British Summer Time (BST) during the summer months. BST is one hour ahead of GMT.
