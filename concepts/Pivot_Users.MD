# Pivot Users

Pivot users are end-users who work with the Pivot tool to create tables, charts, and dashboards without needing to write complex search strings. They rely on data models, managed by Splunk knowledge managers, to design and understand their data. Pivot users select a data model and a dataset from it to generate reports and visualizations.
