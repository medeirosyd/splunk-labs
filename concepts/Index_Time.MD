# Index time

The time span from when Splunk Enterprise receives new data to when the data is written to a Splunk Enterprise index. During that time, the data is parsed into segments and events; default fields and timestamps are extracted; and transforms are applied.

In the context of Splunk Observability Cloud, use index-time rules to transform your data, or a designated subset of your data, during ingestion into Splunk Observability Cloud.
