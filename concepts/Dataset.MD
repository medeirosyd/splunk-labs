*Dataset
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*A dataset is a collection of data stored in Splunk. It can be an index, a job, or a table dataset. When you create a search, you must specify the dataset you want to search. You can also create a dataset by defining initial data, such as an index, source type, or search string. Dataset literals are a type of dataset that can be typed into search criteria.*
