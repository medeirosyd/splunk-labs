# Data Model
A **data model** is a hierarchically structured search-time mapping of semantic knowledge about one or more datasets. 
It encodes domain knowledge necessary to build specialized searches of those datasets, and is used by Splunk software to generate reports for Pivot users. Data models drive the Pivot tool and enable users to create compelling reports and dashboards without designing searches.

*A dataset is a collection of data stored in Splunk. It can be an index, a job, or a table dataset. When you create a search, you must specify the dataset you want to search. You can also create a dataset by defining initial data, such as an index, source type, or search string. Dataset literals are a type of dataset that can be typed into search criteria.*

*Pivot users are end-users who work with the Pivot tool to create tables, charts, and dashboards without needing to write complex search strings. They rely on data models, managed by Splunk knowledge managers, to design and understand their data. Pivot users select a data model and a dataset from it to generate reports and visualizations.*
