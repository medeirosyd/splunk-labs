# visualization

noun

A visual representation of search results from inline searches, pivots, or reports. There are many Splunk platform visualization options, including tables, line charts, Choropleth maps, and single value visualizations.

You can add visualizations to both Dashboard Studio dashboards and Classic Simple XML dashboards. Visualizations in Dashboard Studio use JSON source code, whereas Classic Simple XML dashboards use Simple XML source code. You can either edit source code or use the visual editor to customize a visualization.
