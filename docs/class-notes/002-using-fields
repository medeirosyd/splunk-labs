# SPLUNK DICTIONARY

Field Extraction:
Process of identifying and capturing values in raw event data as fields. Can be automatic or manual (using rex/erex).

rex:
A command used to extract fields using regular expressions from raw data or field values.

erex:
A helper command that generates a regular expression based on provided examples.

Field Aliases:
Alternate names for a field, allowing different field names (e.g., user, username) to be treated as the same field.

Calculated Fields:
Fields created dynamically using expressions (typically via eval) at search time.

Lookups:
External files or tables that enrich search results by adding additional data based on a match.

Event Types:
Named sets of search conditions used to categorize events for reporting or alerting.

Tags:
Labels applied to events or fields to help group and search related data more easily.

Knowledge Objects:
Reusable components (such as field extractions, lookups, event types, tags) that add structure, meaning, or functionality to searches.
