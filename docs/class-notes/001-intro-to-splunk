# Intro to Splunk — Class Notes

These notes summarize key topics and concepts from the Intro to Splunk class.

---

## Splunk Core Concepts

- **Ingestion**: Splunk collects data from diverse sources (logs, metrics, APIs).
- **Indexing**: Data is stored in indexes for fast searching and retrieval.
- **Timestamp**: Each event has a timestamp assigned at index time.
- **Sourcetype / Source / Host**: Metadata to categorize and identify data sources.

---

## Search and SPL (Search Processing Language)

- **Search terms**: Filters applied before the first `|` (pipe). Example:  
  `index=main error OR failure`
- **Commands**: Operations after the pipe. Example: `| stats count by host`
- **Functions**: Calculations inside commands, e.g. `avg()`, `count()`
- **Arguments**: Parameters provided to commands and functions.
- **Clauses**: Modifiers such as `by`, `where`
- **Pipe (`|`)**: Chains commands together.

### Search Best Practices
- Filter before the first pipe for speed: `index=`, `sourcetype=`, `host=`  
- Inclusion is faster than exclusion.  
- Prefer `IN` or `OR` over wide wildcards.  
- Example:  
`index=main status IN (200,201)`

---

## Boolean Logic in Searches

- **Operators**: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- **Evaluation order**: `NOT` → `AND` → `OR`  
- Use parentheses `()` for clarity in complex logic.  
  Example: `Failed AND (NOT password)`

---

## Search Modes

- **Fast**: Faster, minimal field discovery.
- **Smart**: Auto-selects mode based on query.
- **Verbose**: Full field discovery, slower.

---

## Knowledge Objects

Objects that help interpret, enrich, and normalize data:
- **Field extractions**, **calculated fields**
- **Event types**, **transactions**
- **Lookups**, **workflow actions**
- **Tags**, **field aliases**
- **Data models**: Hierarchical structures for data analysis (e.g. CIM)

---

## Dashboards & Visualizations

- **Classic dashboards**: XML-based, basic visuals.
- **Dashboard Studio**: Grid/absolute layout, advanced visuals.
- **Visualization types**: Bar, line, pie charts, single value, more.
- **Elements**: X-axis, Y-axis, chart overlays, format options.

---

## Reports

- Save searches as reports to reuse or schedule.
- **Scheduling**: Cron or interval-based.
- **Permissions**: Owner, app-level, or global (everyone, specific roles).
- Reports always query fresh data.

---

## Roles & Permissions

- **Admin**: Full rights.
- **Power user**: Can create and share objects.
- **User**: Can search and use dashboards.

Roles define what users can see, do, or interact with in Splunk.

---

## SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)

- Splunk SOAR integrates automation into security workflows.
- Allows response playbooks, automation of repetitive tasks, incident management.

## Quiz

# Question:
By default, for how long does a search job remain active in Splunk before it expires?

Options:
A) 10 minutes
B) 30 minutes
C) 7 days

Correct answer:
B) 10 minutes

Explanation:
By default, a search job in Splunk remains active for 10 minutes after completion if it is not saved or interacted with. This time-to-live (TTL) can be modified in the search settings or when saving the search.

# Question:
What is the most efficient way to limit search results returned in Splunk?

Options:
A) host
B) index
C) source
D) time

Correct answer:
D) time

Explanation:
Specifying a time range is the most efficient way to limit search results because it significantly reduces the amount of data that Splunk needs to scan. Time is applied at the index level during the search, so narrowing the time window ensures that only relevant data is retrieved as early as possible in the search process.

While filtering by host, index, or source can also limit results, focusing on time is generally the fastest and most effective way to improve search performance.

# Question:
Which of the following boolean operators can be used in a Splunk search?

Options:
A) NOT
B) AND
C) ALSO
D) OR

Correct answer:
A) NOT
B) AND
D) OR

Explanation:
Splunk supports the boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT to combine or exclude search terms. The operator ALSO is not valid in Splunk search syntax.

Example:
error AND failure NOT password OR timeout

# Question:
By default, who is able to view a saved report in Splunk?

Options:
A) Any user with the viewreports capability
B) The user who created it
C) The user who created it or any user with an admin role
D) Any user with a power or admin role

Correct answer:
B) The user who created it

Explanation:
By default, a saved report in Splunk is private and only visible to the user who created it. It will remain private until the owner or an admin changes its permissions to share it with others.

# Question:
Which search mode behaves differently depending on the type of search being run?

Options:
A) Variable
B) Smart
C) Fast
D) Verbose

Correct answer:
B) Smart

Explanation:
The Smart search mode adjusts its behavior based on the type of search:

For transforming searches (like those using stats or chart), it behaves like Fast mode, focusing on performance and minimal field extraction.

For non-transforming searches (like raw event searches), it behaves like Verbose mode, extracting more fields for detailed results.

Fast and Verbose modes behave consistently regardless of search type, and Variable is not a valid search mode in Splunk.

# Question:
Which character is used in a Splunk search before a command?

Options:
A) A pipe (|)
B) A backtick (`)
C) A tilde (~)
D) A quotation mark (")

Correct answer:
A) A pipe (|)

Explanation:
In Splunk, the pipe (|) character is used to separate and introduce commands in the search pipeline. Each command processes the results of the previous stage in the pipeline.

Example:
index=main | stats count by host

Backtick, tilde, and quotation mark are not used for this purpose in Splunk search syntax.


# Question:
When a search is run, in what order are events returned by default in Splunk?

Options:
A) Reverse alphanumeric order
B) Reverse chronological order
C) Chronological order
D) Alphanumeric order

Correct answer:
B) Reverse chronological order

Explanation:
By default, Splunk returns search results in reverse chronological order, meaning the most recent events appear first. This helps users see the latest data at the top of the results.


# Question:
Which command can be used to further filter results in a search in Splunk?

Options:
A) subsearch
B) subset
C) filter
D) search

Correct answer:
D) search

Explanation:
The search command in Splunk is used to further filter the results of a search pipeline. You can use it after other commands to apply additional conditions or criteria.

Example:
index=main | stats count by host | search count > 10

The other options are not valid commands for this purpose:

subsearch is a search within square brackets that provides input to the main search.

subset is not a valid Splunk command.


# Question:
By default, which of the following roles are required to share knowledge objects in Splunk?

Options:
A) Power
B) User
C) Admin
D) Manager

Correct answer:
A) Power
C) Admin

Explanation:
By default in Splunk, only users with the Power or Admin roles have the capability to share knowledge objects (such as saved searches, reports, and dashboards) with other users. The User role does not have this capability by default.

Note: Manager is not a standard default role in Splunk.

filter is not a valid Splunk command.


# Question:
Which of the following searches will return results containing the words fail, failure, or failed?

Options:
A) fail+
B) fail
C) fail
D) fail

Correct answer:
D) fail*

Explanation:
In Splunk, the asterisk (*) is used as a wildcard for matching patterns. The search term fail* will match any word that starts with "fail", such as:

fail

failed

failure

The other options do not work as intended:

fail+ is not valid syntax in Splunk search.

*fail would match words that end with "fail", not start with it.

fail would only match the exact word "fail".


# Question:
Which Splunk infrastructure component stores ingested data?

Options:
A) Index
B) Data models
C) Dashboards
D) Datasets

Correct answer:
A) Index

Explanation:
An index is the Splunk component that stores ingested data, including both raw data and the index files that make searching efficient.

Data models define structured relationships for searches and reports but do not store data themselves.

Dashboards display search results visually but do not store data.

Datasets represent collections of data for reporting or analysis but are not where raw ingested data is stored.


# Question:
What are the default roles in Splunk Enterprise?

Options:
A) Admin
B) User
C) Power
D) Manager

Correct answer:
A) Admin
B) User
C) Power

Explanation:
Splunk Enterprise comes with three default roles:

Admin: Has full control over all features and settings.

Power: Has elevated capabilities compared to a regular user, such as sharing objects and using advanced search features.

User: A basic role with standard search and viewing capabilities.

Manager is not a default role in Splunk Enterprise. It can be created manually if needed, but it is not included by default.


# Question:
What are the default roles in Splunk Enterprise?

Options:
A) Admin
B) User
C) Power
D) Manager

Correct answer:
A) Admin
B) User
C) Power

Explanation:
Splunk Enterprise includes three default roles:

Admin: Full control over all features, configurations, and settings.

Power: More capabilities than a standard user, including sharing knowledge objects and using advanced search commands.

User: Standard role for searching and viewing data, with no advanced permissions by default.

Manager is not a default role in Splunk Enterprise. It would need to be created manually if desired.

# Question:
What determines the timestamp shown on returned events in a Splunk search?

Options:
A) The time zone defined in user settings
B) The time zone where the event originated
C) Timestamps are displayed in Greenwich Mean Time
D) Timestamps are displayed in epoch time

Correct answer:
A) The time zone defined in user settings

Explanation:
Splunk displays event timestamps according to the time zone set in the user’s preferences. This allows users in different regions or with different preferences to view the same data in a time zone that makes sense for them.

The other options are incorrect:

The event’s originating time zone does not control display timestamps.

Splunk does not default to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) unless set by the user.

Timestamps are not shown in epoch time by default (though epoch time is used internally and can be displayed if specified).
