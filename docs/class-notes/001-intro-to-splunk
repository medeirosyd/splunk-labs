# Intro to Splunk — Class Notes

These notes summarize key topics and concepts from the Intro to Splunk class.

---

## Splunk Core Concepts

- **Ingestion**: Splunk collects data from diverse sources (logs, metrics, APIs).
- **Indexing**: Data is stored in indexes for fast searching and retrieval.
- **Timestamp**: Each event has a timestamp assigned at index time.
- **Sourcetype / Source / Host**: Metadata to categorize and identify data sources.

---

## Search and SPL (Search Processing Language)

- **Search terms**: Filters applied before the first `|` (pipe). Example:  
  `index=main error OR failure`
- **Commands**: Operations after the pipe. Example: `| stats count by host`
- **Functions**: Calculations inside commands, e.g. `avg()`, `count()`
- **Arguments**: Parameters provided to commands and functions.
- **Clauses**: Modifiers such as `by`, `where`
- **Pipe (`|`)**: Chains commands together.

### Search Best Practices
✅ Filter before the first pipe for speed: `index=`, `sourcetype=`, `host=`  
✅ Inclusion is faster than exclusion.  
✅ Prefer `IN` or `OR` over wide wildcards.  
✅ Example:  
`index=main status IN (200,201)`

## Boolean Logic in Searches

- **Operators**: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- **Evaluation order**: `NOT` → `AND` → `OR`  
- Use parentheses `()` for clarity in complex logic.  
  Example: `Failed AND (NOT password)`

## Search Modes

- **Fast**: Faster, minimal field discovery.
- **Smart**: Auto-selects mode based on query.
- **Verbose**: Full field discovery, slower.

---

## Knowledge Objects

Objects that help interpret, enrich, and normalize data:
- **Field extractions**, **calculated fields**
- **Event types**, **transactions**
- **Lookups**, **workflow actions**
- **Tags**, **field aliases**
- **Data models**: Hierarchical structures for data analysis (e.g. CIM)

---

## Dashboards & Visualizations

- **Classic dashboards**: XML-based, basic visuals.
- **Dashboard Studio**: Grid/absolute layout, advanced visuals.
- **Visualization types**: Bar, line, pie charts, single value, more.
- **Elements**: X-axis, Y-axis, chart overlays, format options.

---

## Reports

- Save searches as reports to reuse or schedule.
- **Scheduling**: Cron or interval-based.
- **Permissions**: Owner, app-level, or global (everyone, specific roles).
- Reports always query fresh data.

---

## Roles & Permissions

- **Admin**: Full rights.
- **Power user**: Can create and share objects.
- **User**: Can search and use dashboards.

Roles define what users can see, do, or interact with in Splunk.

## SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)

- Splunk SOAR integrates automation into security workflows.
- Allows response playbooks, automation of repetitive tasks, incident management.
