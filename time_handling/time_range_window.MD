# time range window

noun

The window of time for which a real-time search gathers events.

For example, if you set up a real-time search with a 30-second window, the search timeline and results area displays the number of matching events that have come in over the past 30 seconds.

You can use the time range picker to select a preset time range window or to specify a custom time range window.
