# report

noun

A report is a type of saved search. When you create a search or pivot that you want to use later, save it as a report. You can run the report again by locating the report on the Reports listing page and clicking its name.

You can schedule reports to run on a regular interval. You can configure these scheduled reports to perform actions each time they run, such as emailing the report results to a set of project stakeholders.

You can accelerate slow-completing reports so that they finish faster, using either report acceleration or data model acceleration. Reports that do not qualify for report acceleration can be accelerated through summary indexing.
