# search

noun

The primary way users navigate data in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Platform. You can write a search to retrieve events from an index, use statistical commands to calculate metrics and generate reports, search for specific conditions within a rolling time range window, identify patterns in your data, predict future trends, and so on. You can save searches as reports and use them to power dashboard panels.
