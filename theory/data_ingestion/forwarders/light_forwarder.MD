# light forwarder

noun

A version of a forwarder, a Splunk Enterprise instance that forwards data to another Splunk Enterprise instance or to a third-party system.

A light forwarder has less of an impact on system resources because it does not have as much functionality as a heavy forwarder. You can configure a Splunk Enterprise instance as a light forwarder through the CLI or through Splunk Web.
