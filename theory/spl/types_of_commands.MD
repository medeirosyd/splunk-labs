Types of commands
As you learn about Splunk SPL, you might hear the terms streaming, generating, transforming, orchestrating, and data processing used to describe the types of search commands. This topic explains what these terms mean and lists the commands that fall into each category.
There are six broad categorizations for almost all of the search commands:

distributable streaming
centralized streaming
transforming
generating
orchestrating
dataset processing
These categorizations are not mutually exclusive. Some commands fit into only one categorization. The stats command is an example of a command that fits only into the transforming categorization. Other commands can fit into multiple categorizations. For example a command can be streaming and also generating.

For a complete list of commands that are in each type, see Command types in the Search Reference.
