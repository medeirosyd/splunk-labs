|---------|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| anomalousvalue | Some modes |  |  |  |  |
| anomalydetection | Some modes |  |  |  |  |
| append | Some modes |  |  |  |  |
| appendcols |  |  |  |  |  |
| appendpipe |  |  |  |  |  |
| bin | Some modes. Streaming when span argument is specified. |  |  |  |  |
| cluster | Some modes |  |  |  |  |
| concurrency |  |  |  |  |  |
| datamodel |  |  |  |  |  |
| dedup | sortby or keepevents=true → dataset processing. Otherwise distributable streaming in prededup, then centralized streaming after indexer-level dedup. |  |  |  |  |
