# server class

noun

A group of deployment clients. Server classes facilitate the management of a set of deployment clients as a single unit. A server class can group deployment clients by application, operating system, data type to be indexed, or any other feature of a Splunk Enterprise deployment.

A deployment server uses server classes to determine what content to deploy to groups of deployment clients. The forwarder management interface offers an easy way to create, edit, and manage server classes.
