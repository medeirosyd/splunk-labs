# agent management

noun

A Splunk Enterprise instance that acts as a centralized configuration manager, grouping together and collectively managing any number of Splunk Enterprise instances.

Units of such content are known as deployment apps.

The agent management interface offers an easy way to configure agent management and monitor the status of deployment updates.
