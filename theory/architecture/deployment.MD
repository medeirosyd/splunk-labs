# deployment

noun

A set of distributed Splunk Enterprise instances, working together. A typical deployment scenario consists of a number of forwarders and one or more indexers, with the forwarders sending data to the indexers to index and search. Distributed search is another type of Splunk Enterprise deployment. A single deployment scenario might combine both forwarding and distributed search.

Splunk Enterprise simplifies the management of deployments with its deployment server technology, in which a Splunk Enterprise instance (the deployment server) distributes content and configuration files to a large number of deployed instances (the deployment clients).
