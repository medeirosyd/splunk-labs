# search peer

noun

A Splunk platform instance that responds to search requests from a search head. The term "search peer" is usually synonymous with the indexer role in a distributed search topology. However, other instance types also have access to indexed data, particularly internal diagnostic data, and thus function as search peers when they respond to search requests for that data.
