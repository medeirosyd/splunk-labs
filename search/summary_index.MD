# summary index

noun

A special index that stores the results of a scheduled report, when you enable summary indexing for the report. Summary indexing lets you run fast searches over large data sets by spreading out the cost of a computationally expensive report over time. To achieve this, the search that populates the summary index runs on a frequent, recurring basis and extracts the specific data that you require. You can then run fast and efficient searches against this small subset of data in the summary index.
