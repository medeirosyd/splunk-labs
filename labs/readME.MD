# labs

This directory contains hands-on, structured exercises designed to teach Splunk through guided practice. Labs typically include objectives, instructions, and expected results.

## What is included

- Data ingestion walkthroughs  
- SPL practice activities  
- Dashboard and app development labs  
- Knowledge object workflows  
- Security and SIEM-oriented exercises  

## Purpose

Labs simulate real Splunk workflows and provide step-by-step practice. They are intended to help build practical skills rather than serve as small reference snippets.

## How to use

Choose a lab, follow the steps in your Splunk environment, and compare your results with the expected outcomes. For small, isolated examples, refer to the `/examples` directory.
