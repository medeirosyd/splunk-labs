**Purpose:** Deliver hands-on, guided exercises that simulate real Splunk workflows.  

These labs are longer, structured tasks that teach practical Splunk skills through experience.

The `/labs` directory is built like a learning track:  
each lab is step-by-step, with objectives, datasets, and evaluation criteria.
