This directory contains minimal, self-contained demonstrations of specific Splunk concepts. Each example focuses on one topic only and is designed to be easy to copy, adapt, or reuse.

## What is included

- Small SPL query examples  
- Minimal datasets for testing  
- Short dashboard snippets  
- Configuration fragments (props.conf, transforms.conf, etc.)  

## Purpose

The examples in this folder are intended as quick references or templates. They illustrate a concept without requiring a full lab or multi-step exercise.

## How to use
